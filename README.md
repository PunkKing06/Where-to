# Where to?

An Android app for drivers who just want to go — no destination, ever. It
picks a real road at random at every intersection, shows a close-up,
direction-following driving view like a normal nav app, and just keeps
wandering.

## What it does
1. Finds your current location on a live embedded Google Map.
2. Slide to set the **explore radius** — how large an area of local roads
   to pull in (1–15 km).
3. Tap **"🎲 Start Where to?"** — it downloads the real local street
   network around you and starts walking it: a genuinely random real road
   at every intersection, no destination in mind at all.
4. The screen switches to a close, tilted **driving-mode view** — zoomed
   in, angled down, and rotated to match the direction your phone is
   physically facing (using the device's compass sensor, not just GPS
   movement) — with a **car avatar** marking your position and heading, and
   a card showing your **next up to 3 turns**, spoken aloud as you approach
   each one.
5. It never runs out: once you're down to your last few turns, it quietly
   rolls a fresh random continuation. If you don't take the suggested turn
   — on purpose or by missing it — that's completely fine, it just notices
   you've gone a different real way and keeps randomly wandering from
   wherever you actually are.
6. **☰ (top-left)** opens a side menu to pick your car avatar (a few emoji
   options — sedan, SUV, sports car, taxi, police car, pickup) and to jump
   to **🚻 Nearest Toilet** any time.
7. **🎯 (recenter)** appears if you pan the map away from the driving view;
   tap it to snap back to following your position.
8. **🔊/🔇 (mute)** toggles the spoken turn announcements on or off.
9. **"⏹ Stop Drive"** ends the session and brings back the setup panel.

### Driving-mode view
- **Flat, dark, road-aligned camera**: no tilt/3D angle — a flat, top-down
  view rotated so "up" always matches the direction of the road you're on,
  rendered in a dark night-mode map style (applied only while a drive is
  active; the setup screen keeps the normal map style).
- **Heading comes from the road itself, not the phone's compass.** Earlier
  versions used the device's compass sensor for rotation, but that caused
  real problems: compass readings jump around from magnetic interference or
  a phone mounted at an angle that doesn't match the car's actual direction
  of travel, which both disoriented the view and — since the camera framing
  math depended on that same jittery value — could momentarily push the car
  marker out of frame after tapping recenter. Now the bearing is derived
  directly from the road geometry: whichever segment of the current planned
  path the car is nearest to, that segment's own bearing is used for both
  the camera and the car marker's rotation. It only changes when the car
  actually moves onto a different segment, so it's stable and always
  literally parallel to the road.
- **Car sits low on screen via map padding**, not a manually-offset camera
  target. `GoogleMap.setPadding()` — Google's own documented mechanism for
  this — shifts where the camera's target renders: padding on an edge
  shrinks the "visible" region away from that edge, and the target centers
  within what's left. So *top* padding (not bottom) is what pushes the
  visible center — and the car — down toward the bottom of the screen,
  with the padded-away space above revealing more of the road ahead. This
  is simpler and more robust than computing a manual forward offset (which
  is what caused an earlier "car not in view" bug).
- **Recenter** re-engages the same framing immediately: same fixed zoom,
  same padding, same road-derived bearing.
- **Arrow puck avatar, on by default.** After feedback that the drawn car
  icon still didn't read as a convincing car, the default avatar is now the
  classic rounded-chevron navigation arrow — the same basic shape Google
  Maps' own default location puck uses — solid color with a white outline
  and a soft drop shadow. The car icon from before is still available as an
  alternate option in the hamburger drawer, alongside the arrow.
  **Both are still flat 2D drawings, not true 3D models** — the public
  Google Maps SDK for Android has no API for rendering an actual 3D vehicle
  as a marker; the rotating 3D cars in the real Google Maps/Waze apps are
  rendered by Google's own internal engine, not something exposed to
  outside developers. A more realistic look than either of these drawn
  icons would mean supplying actual car sprite/render image assets to swap
  in as the marker bitmap — happy to wire that in if you get some.
- **Bigger avatar**: sized to visually read larger than the road itself.
- **Clean, solid Maps-style route line**: a soft light-blue outline under a
  brighter blue core, wide enough to visually cover the street — matching
  Google Maps' own route highlighting, not a glowing/neon effect (an
  earlier version tried a multi-layer transparent "glow" stack; this is
  simpler and closer to how Maps itself actually looks).
- **Road-snapped position**: unchanged from before — the marker's on-screen
  position is projected onto the nearest point actually on the current
  planned road polyline, so it stays centered on the street even with
  noisy GPS (indoors, multipath, etc). The *navigation logic*
  (arrival/deviation detection) still uses your true raw GPS position.

**Honest limitations on this part:**
- Both avatar options are flat, procedurally-drawn 2D bitmaps — see above
  for why true 3D isn't achievable via the public Maps SDK.
- Road-snapping and road-derived bearing both project onto the *currently
  planned* path polyline, not the whole fetched road graph — if you're
  genuinely off that path (which the app treats as normal, see below), the
  snap briefly follows whatever the nearest segment of the old path is
  until a new path is generated.
- The bottom-padding fraction and fixed nav zoom are constants
  (`BOTTOM_PADDING_FRACTION`, `NAV_ZOOM` at the top of `MainActivity.kt`) —
  not dynamically computed from how far away your next turn is. Simpler
  and more predictable than the earlier lookahead-zoom approach, at the
  cost of not automatically zooming out further for a farther-away turn.

### Genuinely random turn-by-turn (not a route to a point)
Earlier versions of this app either launched Google Maps to one random
point, or fetched one computed "best route" to one random point from a free
routing engine. Both of those are still just **one deterministic path to a
fixed destination** — accurate, but not actually random once you're moving.

This version is different: it pulls the real local road network — every
street segment and intersection — from **OpenStreetMap** via the free
Overpass API (same source already used for the toilet finder), builds a
graph out of it (nodes = intersections, edges = real road segments,
respecting one-way streets), and then does a genuine **random walk**: at
every intersection, it rolls dice among the real connected roads and picks
one, for several intersections ahead. There is no destination anywhere in
this process — it's turn-by-turn randomness, not routing.

Only road types normally open to general car traffic are pulled in
(motorways down through residential streets and living streets) — footways,
cycleways, paths, tracks, and steps are excluded by the Overpass query
itself, and service roads (driveways, parking-lot lanes, alleys) are
excluded too, since those technically allow cars but don't feel like real
driving roads. Beyond that, two further filters are applied to each way:

- **Access restrictions**: excluded if tagged `access`, `motor_vehicle`, or
  `vehicle` equal to any of `no`, `private`, `permit`, `customers`,
  `delivery`, `agricultural`, `forestry`, or `destination`. That last one is
  deliberate — "destination" access technically permits driving in if
  that's specifically where you're headed, but this app has no real
  destination, so a road meant only for people actually going somewhere
  specific there doesn't fit a random wander.
- **Narrow roads**: excluded if tagged with an explicit `width` under
  ~3.5 meters, marked `passing_places=yes` (a tag some mappers use
  specifically for single-track roads with passing bays), or tagged with
  exactly one lane on a road that *isn't* one-way (the classic pattern for
  a bidirectional single-track lane).

This isn't a perfect guarantee — OpenStreetMap tagging quality and
coverage (especially `width`/`lanes`) varies a lot by area, so a road with
no relevant tags at all can't be filtered by something that was never
recorded for it. It should meaningfully cut down on private driveways,
permit-only roads, and single-track lanes in well-mapped areas, but isn't
airtight everywhere.

Turn instructions ("turn left onto Elm Street," "continue straight onto Elm
Street") are generated by comparing the bearing of the road you're on to
the bearing of the road you're turning onto at each intersection — no
routing engine involved, just geometry plus the street name OpenStreetMap
has tagged for that segment.

While a drive is active, the app tracks your live GPS position and:
- **Speaks each upcoming turn** via Android's built-in text-to-speech, with
  an early "in 150 meters, turn left onto X" warning plus the turn itself
  as you reach it.
- **Extends the walk** with new random intersections once you're down to
  your final few upcoming turns, so it never runs dry.
- **Treats going a different way as normal, not an error** — since the
  planned path was only ever a suggestion, if you're more than ~60m off it
  (missed the turn, or just felt like going somewhere else), the app
  quietly starts a fresh random walk from wherever you actually ended up.
  Arrival at the end of the currently-generated walk works the same way.
- **Refetches the local road graph** once you've wandered close to the edge
  of the area it originally downloaded, so it always has real nearby roads
  to keep choosing from.
- **Runs a close, tilted, direction-following camera** — zoomed in, angled
  down, rotated to match your heading (from GPS bearing when moving, or the
  direction of the next turn when slow/stopped) — the same visual language
  as a normal driving-mode nav app, rather than a flat top-down map.

**Honest limitations:**
- **Foreground only.** Tracking happens from inside the app's own screen.
  If you lock your phone or switch apps, it pauses. Keep the app open and
  the screen on while driving (a dash mount helps).
- **No live traffic, lane guidance, or speed limits** — those are things
  Google's own navigation stack does that a hobby project reasonably can't
  replicate. This is turn-by-turn direction, not a full nav replacement.
- **Nearest-node snapping is straight-line, not true map-matching.** Your
  live GPS position is matched to the closest intersection node by simple
  distance, not projected onto the nearest road segment. In practice this
  is fine at normal GPS accuracy and OSM's typical node density, but on a
  long, sparse rural road you might occasionally see it register a turn a
  few meters early or late.
- **Overpass query size grows with the explore radius and how densely
  mapped your area is.** A large radius in a dense city can mean a bigger,
  slower fetch. The 1–15 km slider range and the default of 3 km are
  chosen to keep this reasonable; `router.project-osrm.org`'s sibling,
  `overpass-api.de`, is a shared free public server meant for light use —
  fine for one driver's app, but if it ever feels slow, try a smaller
  radius or look at self-hosting Overpass.
- **Route-deviation detection checks distance to the whole planned
  polyline**, not just the unfinished portion ahead — on a walk that loops
  back near itself, this could rarely under-trigger. Not a big deal for a
  casual drive.
- Tuning constants live at the top of `MainActivity.kt`: `DEVIATION_METERS`
  (60m), `ARRIVAL_METERS` (30m), `WARNING_METERS` (150m), `LOW_STEPS_THRESHOLD`
  (3), `REFETCH_FRACTION` (0.7), `NAV_ZOOM` (18.5 — the fixed driving-mode
  zoom level), `BOTTOM_PADDING_FRACTION` (0.55 — how much of the screen
  height is reserved below the car via map padding). The random walk's
  look-ahead depth (`desiredHops`, default 12 intersections) is a parameter
  on `OsmRoadGraph.buildRandomPath()`.

### Nearest toilet
Google's Places data doesn't actually have a filterable "public restroom"
category — restroom is just a yes/no attribute attached to other venues, not
its own place type. So this feature queries **OpenStreetMap's free Overpass
API** instead, which has real, purpose-tagged public toilet locations
worldwide, and needs no API key or billing. It searches a 3 km radius first,
then 10 km if nothing turns up, picks the closest result, and launches
driving navigation straight to it. If OSM has nothing mapped nearby, it
falls back to opening a plain "public restroom" search in Google Maps so
you're never left with a dead button.

Two things worth knowing:
- Coverage depends on how well your area is mapped in OpenStreetMap — dense
  in most cities, sparser in rural areas.
- The public `overpass-api.de` endpoint is rate-limited for heavy/commercial
  use. For occasional personal use this is fine; if you want to scale this
  up, look at self-hosting Overpass or an alternative mirror.

## Setup (required before it will run)

1. **Open in Android Studio.** File → Open → select the `WhereTo` folder.
   Let Gradle sync (it will download dependencies automatically).

2. **Get a Google Maps API key** — see "Getting a Google Maps API key"
   below for a full walkthrough. Free for this app's usage (Maps SDK for
   Android has unlimited free mobile usage), though Google still requires
   billing to be enabled on the project to issue the key at all.

3. **For GitHub Actions builds, add the key as a repository Actions secret**
   named `MAPS_API_KEY`. The build workflow injects it into the manifest only
   while building, so the key is not stored in the repository. For a local
   Android Studio build, supply the key locally and do not commit it.

4. **Run it** on a device or emulator with Google Play services and the
   Google Maps app installed (an emulator with a "Google APIs" or
   "Google Play" system image works; a plain AOSP image won't have Maps).

## Getting a Google Maps API key

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com, sign in, and create a new
   project (top project dropdown → New Project).
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → search "Maps SDK for Android" → **Enable**.
   That's the only API this project needs — don't enable Places, Directions,
   etc., since those aren't free and nothing here calls them.
3. **Billing** → link a card. Required by Google to issue any key, even
   though your actual usage here will be free.
4. **APIs & Services → Credentials** → **+ Create Credentials → API key**.
   Copy the key that appears.
5. Click into the new key to restrict it:
   - **Application restrictions → Android apps → Add an item:**
     - Package name: `com.example.whereto`
     - SHA-1 certificate fingerprint: **`B3:79:E7:4E:CB:E6:16:3A:FB:0C:87:38:F8:E9:A7:26:2B:CD:C7:44`**

       This is the fingerprint of the `app/debug.keystore` file already
       committed in this project (see "About the debug keystore" below) —
       you don't need Android Studio, `keytool`, or any local tooling to
       get it; it's the same for every clone of this repo and every CI
       build.
   - **API restrictions → Restrict key →** check only "Maps SDK for Android."
   - Save.
6. Add the key as the `MAPS_API_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. The build workflow
   injects it into the manifest during the build.

### About the debug keystore
Android signs every debug build with a "debug keystore" — normally your
machine (or CI runner) auto-generates one the first time you build, with a
random signing key. That's a problem for a key restricted to a specific
SHA-1: your laptop, your desktop, and every fresh GitHub Actions run would
each get a *different* random fingerprint, so the restriction would keep
breaking.

To avoid that, this project **commits a fixed `app/debug.keystore`** and
`app/build.gradle` points the `debug` build variant at it explicitly. Every
build — local or CI — signs with the same key, so the SHA-1 above is stable
forever. (Committing a *debug* keystore like this is normal and fine; it's
not sensitive. Never do this with a real release keystore.)

## Getting an APK without installing Android Studio

If you just want an installable `.apk` and don't want to set up Android
Studio, this project includes a GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) that builds one for you in the cloud:

1. Create a new (can be private) GitHub repo and push this folder to it.
2. Get a Maps API key — see "Getting a Google Maps API key" above.
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New
   repository secret**, name it `MAPS_API_KEY`, and paste your key in.
4. Go to the **Actions** tab → **Build APK** workflow → **Run workflow**
   (or just push a commit — it runs automatically).
5. Once it finishes (a couple of minutes), open the run and download the
   **WhereTo-debug-apk** artifact — it's a zip containing `app-debug.apk`.
6. Copy that APK to your phone and open it. You'll need to allow
   "install unknown apps" for whatever app you use to open it (Files,
   Chrome, etc.) — this is normal for any app installed outside the Play
   Store, since it's a debug build, not something signed for the Store.

This produces a **debug** build — fine for installing on your own phone, but
not signed for Play Store distribution. If you eventually want to publish
it, Android Studio can generate a proper signed release build/bundle.

## Permissions
Just location — that's it. There's no foreground service or notification
permission anymore, since navigation tracking now happens directly in the
app's own screen rather than a background service.

## Notes / things you might want to tweak
- `minSdk 23` (Android 6.0+) — covers the vast majority of active devices.
- The random point is **not checked against water** before routing to it —
  OSRM's routing itself will refuse/fail gracefully if a point is
  unreachable by road (e.g. literally in a lake), which triggers the normal
  "couldn't fetch a route" retry path rather than crashing, but you may
  occasionally see a route that looks like it's heading toward a coastline.
- The nearest-toilet feature still hands off to the real Google Maps app for
  navigation — a single fixed real destination is better served by Google's
  full turn-by-turn voice guidance and live traffic than by this app's
  simpler in-app version, which exists specifically for the open-ended
  "just keep driving randomly" case.
- No app icon is bundled — Android Studio will use a default one. Add your
  own via Image Asset Studio (right-click `res` → New → Image Asset) if you
  want a custom one.
